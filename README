Trying to implement the "Context Sensitive Help" of Padre in a stand alone module.

It has a command line interface that comes with this package.

It is also implemented as part of the Hyppolit IRC bot used on the #padre channel in irc.perl.org

The plan is to factor out all the "Context Sensitive Help" of Padre 
and then make Padre depend on this module providing a GUI interface to this.

There is a plan to build a web interface as well.
